 *  Program that simulates a simplified version of blackjack using a 14 sided
 *  die. A roll selects one of 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10,11. Jack, Queen, and
 *  King are worth 10 while an Ace is 11 The player is given two rolls. The
 *  house, played by the computer, is given one roll. The player is shown the
 *  value of the houseâ€™s roll and given the option to stand or hit The house then
 *  hits till it is equel to 17 or higher. If either the player or the house hits
 *  over 21 they bust and lose the round If Player and House tie then the win
 *  goes to the House
